        I can travel in all sorts of crazy ways, but I will take you back to something that happened over 10 years ago on a Tuesday morning.
        You're going to need to shut your brain off.
        Are you ready?
        Alright, go to 1996.
        I go into my first job at the Veejay Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland.`,

        Oh, I was so happy, I picked out the border that I fell in love with at 11: 00 last night and headed off to bed.
        
        I needed to be up early in the morning to go to our pumpkin carving party, which went well.
        
        The pumpkin pieces were a little more difficult to carve than usual, though they turned out okay.
        
        Some of them looked more like the ghosts I wanted.
        
        If I try again, I'll have to make them look more like they're supposed to be.
        
        After Halloween, there are many houseguests coming.
        
        I won't have time to work on it.
        
        But I'll try not to drop my knitting.`,

        I wanted to write this story because when I was a little girl, my parents read me Jan de Hartog's "One false move" and "And the earth moved" over and over.
        
        My parents said that the best childhood stories should always have a happy ending.
        
        This one did, for me at least.
        
        Oh, if they only knew how angry I am that the book is actually called "Two gone bad" by now.
        
        Never saw that one coming.`,
